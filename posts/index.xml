    <description><![CDATA[Short Summary This paper proposed a NAND-flash SSD-friendly full text engine. This engine can achieve better performance than existing engines with much less memory requestsed.
They reduce the unnecessary I/O (both the number of I/O and the volume). The engine does not cache data into memory, instead, read data every time when query arrive.
They also tried to increase the request size to exploit SSD internal parallelism.
