<!-- # Gy's Blog -->

I tried static site generators such as hugo, hexo, jekylly to build my blogs.
But I found out that I put too much effort into the static site generators
instead of focusing on the content.

Then one day I realised that why did not I just put everything in to plain text
files and organized them into folders as I want. No extra tools and efforts
required.

Let's build a simple and clean life style!
