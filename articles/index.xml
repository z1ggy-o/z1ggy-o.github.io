      <description>Short Summary What Is the Problem Search engines pose great challenges to storage systems:
 low latency high data throughput high scalability  The datasets become too large to fit into the RAM. Simply use RAM as a cache cannot achieve the goal.
SSD and NVRAM can boost performance well. For example, flash-based SSDs provide much higher throughput and lower latency compared to HDD. However, since SSDs exhibit vastly different characteristic from HDDs, we need to evolve the software on top of the storage stack to exploit the full potential of SSDs.</description>
